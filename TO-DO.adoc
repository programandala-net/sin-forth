  documentation of the assembler.

- Update the documentation of the assembler.

- Move `tail-call?` and similar private words to a new word list, e.g.
  `compiler-tools-wordlist`, accesible in a `compiler-definitions` context but
  not in a `target-definitions` context. Or move the public words from
  `compiler-wordlist` to `compiler-wordlist`. For example, also `memory`,
  `t-,`, `initial-target` etc., should not be accesible during the
  compilation of the target, just in case.
- Make the stacks size configurable.
- Make the data stack growing direction configurable.
- Add `literal`, `2literal`, `cliteral`, `xliteral`, `sliteral`.
- Make verbosity configurable.  
- Add a compiler `'` to get the target compilation address of a word
  defined by the compiler's `:`.
- Add an option to create a labels file, compatible with z80dasm.
