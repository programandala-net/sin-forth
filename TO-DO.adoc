- Update the documentation of the assembler.

== 2020-12-07

- Move `tail-call?` and similar private words to a new word list, e.g.
  `compiler-tools-wordlist`, accesible in a `compiler-definitions` context but
  not in a `target-definitions` context. Or move the public words from
  `compiler-wordlist` to `compiler-wordlist`. For example, also `memory`,
  `t-,`, `initial-target` etc., should not be accesible during the
  compilation of the target, just in case.
- Make the data stack growing direction configurable.
- Add `2literal`, `cliteral`, `xliteral`.
- Make verbosity configurable.

== 2020-12-08

- Make the configuration directives homogenous and analog, in order to
  prevent name clashes, also with words like `on` and `off`,  when
  they are used inside the target program.

== 2020-12-09

- Improve `>z80-label` to replace "-" with "_" or "minus" depending on
  the name.

== 2020-12-10

- Use the _dea_ notation, borrowed from the lina Forth system.
- Mark the stack comments of compiler words, to make it clear it's the
  Gforth's stack, not the target stack.
- Rename `'`?

== 2020-12-11

- Use shorter names for `literal`, `2literal`, `cliteral`, `xliteral`,
  `sliteral`.

== 2020-12-24

- Add macros to preserve the alternate `hl'` register, which must be
  preserved in order to return to BASIC.
- Add flag to compile fast or slow versions of some words.

== 2020-12-25

- Rename `after` to its original name `aft`; rename `step` to its
  usual name `next`.
- Factor `push-a` from `count`?
- Document the standard words used by the compiler.
- Uniform the notation of the compilation data stack, e.g. "C:".

== 2020-12-26

- Make `cr` a deferred word.

== 2023-04-21

- Build tests also with apenwarr/redo.

== 2023-04-25

Remove consecutive `push` and `pop`, like in this case:

----
ld hl,00001h
call _push_hl
call _pop_hl
ld a,l
or h
jp z,l9d39h
----

The source of that example is the following:

----
1 literal if
----

- Fix execution of <src/test/test_dot.fs>.

== 2023-04-26

- Create the target word names in a specific word list?
- Add alternative to `literal` to pass values in registers instead of
  the stack, e.g. `'A' >a emit-a`, or just add the additional entry
  points and use assembly: `'A' a ld#, emit-a`.
- Move `compiler-wordlist` before `assembler-wordlist` in
  `compiler-order` and `target-order`?
- Add pronounciation to word definitions.
- Move `<mark` and similar words from the assembler to their own
  library files.
- Write `do`.
- Remove unnecesary `compiler{` and `assembler{` in library modules.
- Find a solution to compile numbers and strings without `literal`,
  `sliteral`, etc. For example, a custom outer interpreter.

== 2023-04-27

- Confirm no module is included twice because of the way `require`
  checks the paths.

== 2023-04-29

- Document the target effect of `;` in library modules: `ret`.
- Add `s"` to parse and compile strings.
- Add words to parse and compile numbers, e.g. `h#`, `d#`, `b#`, `o#`.
