- Update the documentation of the assembler.

== 2020-12-07

- Move `tail-call?` and similar private words to a new word list, e.g.
  `compiler-tools-wordlist`, accesible in a `compiler-definitions` context but
  not in a `target-definitions` context. Or move the public words from
  `compiler-wordlist` to `compiler-wordlist`. For example, also `memory`,
  `t-,`, `initial-target` etc., should not be accesible during the
  compilation of the target, just in case.
- Make the data stack growing direction configurable.
- Add `2literal`, `cliteral`, `xliteral`.
- Make verbosity configurable.

== 2020-12-08

- Make the configuration directives homogenous and analog, in order to
  prevent name clashes, also with words like `on` and `off`,  when
  they are used inside the target program.

== 2020-12-09

- Make `memory>` use the `dp` target variable.
- Improve `>z80-label` to replace "-" with "_" or "minus" depending on
  the name.

== 2020-12-10

- Use the _dea_ notation, taken from the lina Forth system.
- Mark the stack comments of compiler words, to make it clear it's the
  Gforth's stack, not the target stack.
- Rename `'`?

== 2020-12-11

- Extract the code start addresses from the source and pass it to
  `z80dasm` in <Makefile>.
- Use shorter names for `literal`, `2literal`, `cliteral`, `xliteral`,
  `sliteral`.

== 2020-12-24

- Add macros to preserve the alternate `hl'` register, which must be
  preserved in order to return to BASIC.
- Add flag to compile fast or slow versions of some words.

== 2020-12-25

- Combine `drop` and `2drop`. `drop` can be a second entry point of
  `2drop`.
- Rename `after` to its original name `aft`; rename `step` to its
  usual name `next`.
- Factor `push-a` from `count`.
- Document the standard words used by the compiler.
- Document the "h-" and "t-" words.
- Uniform the notation of the compilation data stack, e.g. "C:".

== 2020-12-26

- Make `cr` a deferred word.
- Add a rule to build any individual test by its basename.
- Fix the position of parsed arguments in stack comments.

== 2023-04-21

- Add `0until`, used by a test.
- Build tests also with apenwarr/redo.
- Add license.
