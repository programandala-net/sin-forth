- Update non-standard throw codes 22 in the assembler.
- Update the documentation of the assembler.

- Move `tail-call?` and similar private words to a new word list, e.g.
  `compiler-tools-wordlist`, accesible in a `compiler-definitions` context but
  not in a `target-definitions` context. Or move the public words from
  `compiler-wordlist` to `compiler-wordlist`. For example, also `memory`,
  `t-,`, `initial-target` etc., should not be accesible during the
  compilation of the target, just in case.
- Make the data stack growing direction configurable.
- Add `2literal`, `cliteral`, `xliteral`, `sliteral`.
- Make verbosity configurable.
- Add a compiler `'` to get the target compilation address of a word
  defined by the compiler's `:`.

- Make the configuration directives homogenous and analog, in order to
  prevent name clashes, also with words like `on` and `off`,  when
  they are used inside the target programa.

== 2020-12-09

- Make `memory>` use the `dp` target variable.
- Improve `>z80-label` to replace "-" with "_" or "minus" depending on
  the name.

== 2020-12-10

- Use the _dea_ notation, taken from the lina Forth system.
- Mark the stack comments of compiler words, to make it clear it's the
  Gforth's stack, not the target stack.
- Rename `'`?

== 2020-12-11

- Extract the code start addresses from the source and pass it to
  `z80dasm` in <Makefile>.
- Use shorter names for `literal`, `2literal`, `cliteral`, `xliteral`,
  `sliteral`.
- Rename `'` to `[']`, more coherent with the apparently "immediate"
  behaviour of the compiler words.
