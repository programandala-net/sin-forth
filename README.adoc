// Installation {{{1
== Installation

In order to use Sin Forth, its sources must be accessible from Gforth.

One method is to add the Sin Forth's <src> directory to Gforth's
`fpath`. Consult the documentation of Gforth.

A second method is to make a symbolic link to Sin Forth's <src>
directory from Gforth's <site-forth> directory. In a locally compiled
Gforth, the command on a Linux shell would be the following:

----
sudo ln -s ~/YOUR-PATH/src/ /usr/local/share/gforth/site-forth/sin_forth
----

where "YOUR-PATH" must be replaced with the corresponding path to Sin
Forth's <src> directory on your system.

// Requirements {{{1
== Requirements

Sin Forth uses some modules of the
http://programandala.net/en.program.galope.html[Galope library].

Some of modules of Galope need the http://irdvo.nl/FFL/[Forth
Foundation Library].
