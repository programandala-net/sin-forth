== Installation

In order to use Sin Forth, its sources must be accessible from Gforth.

One method is to add the Sin Forth <src/> directory to Gforth
`fpath`. Consult the Gforth documentation.

A second method is to make a symbolic link to Sin Forth's <src>
directory from Gforth's <site-forth> directory. In a locally compiled
Gforth, the command on a Linux shell would be the following:

----
sudo ln -s ~/YOUR-PATH/src/ /usr/local/share/gforth/site-forth/sin_forth
----

where "YOUR-PATH" must be replaced with the corresponding path on your
system.
