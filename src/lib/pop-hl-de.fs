  \ pop-hl-de  ( x1 x2 | d -- )
  \
  \ First pop _x2_ to into the ``HL`` Z80 register. Then pop
  \ _x1_ into the ``DE`` Z80 register. The cell pair _x1 x2_
  \ can be seen also a double number _d_, equivalent to the content of
  \ the theoretic register pair ``HLDE``, being ``HL`` its high part
  \ (on top of stack) and ``DE`` its low part.
