  \ push-de-hl  ( -- x1 x2 | d )
  \
  \ First push the content of the ``DE`` Z80 register _x1_. Then push
  \ the content of the ``HL`` Z80 register _x2_. The cell pair _x1 x2_
  \ can be seen also a double number _d_, equivalent to the content of
  \ the theoretic register pair ``HLDE``, being ``HL`` its high part
  \ (on top of stack) and ``DE`` its low part.
  \
  \ See also: `pop-hl-de`, `push-hl-de`, `push-de`, `push-hl`,
  \ `push-a`.
